## User Story
I need a new, entertaining experience to spend my time indoors that doesnâ€™t include more binge watching television. A virtual reality escape room is a fun activity to do inside and I can compare my high score with others that have played, allowing me to compete and connect with family and friends.

## Version 1.0
* This employee-directory app runs via github pages or by entering the command "npm start" to initialize the react server.
* Make sure you are in the main folder when running the code on the command line.
* This app does have two pages a "Home" and "Employees" page.  The employees page displays renders random employees in the table from the 'https://randomuser.me/api/?results=50&nat=us' api.  The employees table is searchable based on criteria in the searchbar and dropdown.  User can also click on the "full name" and "years with company" to sort the table based on those columns.
